# WordNet

**WordNet** is a **large lexical database of English**, developed at Princeton University.

Instead of being a regular dictionary, it’s structured **like a network of meanings** — words are grouped into **synonym sets** called **synsets**, and these synsets are connected by **semantic relationships**.

> ✅ Think of WordNet as:  
> “A dictionary + a thesaurus + a concept graph.”

## Why is WordNet important in NLP?

It helps NLP models:

- Understand word **meanings**
- Disambiguate between different senses of a word
- Measure **semantic similarity**
- Traverse **relationships** like synonyms, antonyms, part-whole, etc.

## Installing and Importing WordNet (via NLTK)

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('omw-1.4')   # for multilingual WordNet
from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn
```

## 🔹 Synsets: Sets of Synonyms Representing One Meaning

Each **Synset** in WordNet represents a **single concept or word sense**, and contains:

|Element|Description|
|---|---|
|**Lemmas**|Words that express the same concept|
|**Definition**|Gloss (short definition of the concept)|
|**Examples**|Sample usage sentences|

#### Example: Synsets for "car"

```python
for syn in wn.synsets("car"):
    print(f"Name: {syn.name()}")
    print(f"Lemmas: {[lemma.name() for lemma in syn.lemmas()]}")
    print(f"Definition: {syn.definition()}")
    print(f"Examples: {syn.examples()}")
    print("-" * 40)
```

**Output (trimmed)**:

```
Name: car.n.01
Lemmas: ['car', 'auto', 'automobile', 'machine', 'motorcar']
Definition: a motor vehicle with four wheels; usually propelled by an internal combustion engine
Examples: ['he needs a car to get to work']

Name: car.n.02
Lemmas: ['car', 'railcar', 'railway_car', 'railroad_car']
Definition: a wheeled vehicle adapted to the rails of railroad
Examples: ['the train had ten cars']
```

This shows:

- **Two meanings of “car”**
- Each is stored in a separate **synset**
- Lemmas are **synonyms**
- WordNet captures **senses**, not just words

## WordNet Structure: Part-of-Speech Categories

WordNet organizes synsets by **Part of Speech (POS)**:

|POS Tag|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`.n.`|**Nouns** – tangible or abstract entities|`car.n.01`|
|`.v.`|**Verbs** – actions or processes|`run.v.01`|
|`.a.`|**Adjectives** – properties, states|`fast.a.01`|
|`.r.`|**Adverbs** – manner, degree, etc.|`quickly.r.01`|

Each synset has a name like:

> `car.n.01`  
> This means:

- Word: **car**
- POS: **noun**
- Sense number: **1**

---

## Accessing Synsets by POS

```python
# Get only noun senses of "run"
run_nouns = wn.synsets('run', pos=wn.NOUN)
print([syn.name() for syn in run_nouns])
```

## Quick Functions You’ll Use with WordNet

|Function|What It Does|
|---|---|
|`wn.synsets("word")`|Get all synsets (senses) of a word|
|`synset.lemmas()`|Get all lemma names (synonyms) in that synset|
|`synset.definition()`|Get the gloss/definition of the synset|
|`synset.examples()`|Example usage|
|`lemma.antonyms()`|Get antonyms of a word|

---

## Real-Life Use Case Example

Let's get synonyms and antonyms of the word "happy":

```python
synonyms = []
antonyms = []

for syn in wn.synsets("happy"):
    for lemma in syn.lemmas():
        synonyms.append(lemma.name())
        if lemma.antonyms():
            antonyms.append(lemma.antonyms()[0].name())

print("Synonyms:", set(synonyms))
print("Antonyms:", set(antonyms))
```

## Structure Summary of WordNet

|POS Type|What It Contains|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Noun|Objects, concepts, people, places|car, school, freedom|
|Verb|Actions, events|run, eat, think|
|Adjective|Attributes, properties|red, fast, strong|
|Adverb|Describes how an action is done|quickly, slowly|

Each POS category also has unique relationships:

- Nouns: **hypernyms, hyponyms, meronyms**
- Verbs: **entailments, troponyms**
- Adjectives: **similar_to, attribute_of**
- Adverbs: often derived from adjectives

We'll explore all those relationships later.
