# Word Meaning and Lexemes

## What Is a Word?

In NLP, we often think of a **word** as just a string of characters separated by spaces (a ‚Äútoken‚Äù) ‚Äî but that's not the whole story.

Example:

- "run", "running", "ran", and "runs" ‚Äî all look like different words, but they share a **common meaning**.

So we say they are **different word forms** of the **same lexeme**.

---

## What Is a Lexeme?

> A **lexeme** is the **base unit of lexical meaning**. It represents the abstract idea of a word, **regardless of its inflected form**.

|Word Forms|Lexeme|
|---|---|
|run, runs, ran, running|**RUN** (the lexeme)|

**Think of lexemes as the dictionary entry**. The word form depends on tense, plurality, etc.

---

## üí° Lexeme vs Lemma vs Word

|Term|What It Means|Example (from "run")|
|---|---|---|
|**Word**|Actual word form used in text|"running", "ran"|
|**Lemma**|Canonical base form used in analysis (what you lemmatize to)|"run"|
|**Lexeme**|Abstract unit representing shared meaning across forms|"RUN" (as a concept)|

In most NLP tools like spaCy or WordNet, **lexeme ‚âà lemma**, but not always ‚Äî lexeme is more theoretical.

## Word Meaning: Polysemy vs Homonymy

Words often have **multiple meanings**. These are categorized based on **relatedness** of meaning.

### üîπ 1. **Polysemy** ‚Äì _Same word, related meanings_

> One lexeme with multiple related senses.

**Example:**

- "paper" (material)
- "paper" (newspaper)
- "paper" (academic paper)

üëâ These meanings are **conceptually connected**.

### üîπ 2. **Homonymy** ‚Äì _Same word, unrelated meanings_

> One spelling, but meanings have **different origins**.

**Example:**

- "bat" (flying animal)
- "bat" (cricket equipment)

üëâ These are **different lexemes**, **accidentally spelled the same**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è In WordNet

WordNet organizes words into **synsets** (sets of synonyms that represent a single sense of a lexeme).

Each synset includes:

- A list of **lemmas** (word forms)
- A **definition** (gloss)
- **Examples**
- **Relations** to other synsets (e.g., hypernyms)

```python
from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn

# Let's explore "run"
for syn in wn.synsets("run"):
    print(f"Synset: {syn.name()}")
    print(f"Definition: {syn.definition()}")
    print(f"Examples: {syn.examples()}")
    print(f"Lemmas: {[lemma.name() for lemma in syn.lemmas()]}")
    print("-" * 40)
```

### Output Sample:

```
Synset: run.n.01
Definition: a score in baseball made by a runner reaching home base safely
Examples: ['the Yankees scored 3 runs in the bottom of the 9th']
Lemmas: ['run']

Synset: run.v.01
Definition: move fast by using one's feet, with one foot off the ground at any given time
Examples: ['Don't run--you'll be out of breath']
Lemmas: ['run']
```

Each synset shows a **distinct sense**, which helps with **Word Sense Disambiguation**.

---

## Why This Matters in NLP

Understanding lexemes helps NLP systems:

- Avoid confusion between **different meanings** of the same word
- Choose correct **translation** in multilingual systems
- Power **word sense disambiguation**
- Create smarter **chatbots and assistants**

---

## Activity: Try It Yourself

Use this code to list **distinct meanings** of any word:

```python
from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn

def explore_word(word):
    synsets = wn.synsets(word)
    print(f"\nFound {len(synsets)} meanings for '{word}':\n")
    for i, syn in enumerate(synsets, 1):
        print(f"{i}. {syn.name()}")
        print(f"   ‚Ü≥ Definition: {syn.definition()}")
        print(f"   ‚Ü≥ Examples: {syn.examples()}\n")

explore_word("bank")
```

Try this with:

- _"light"_
- _"crane"_
- _"rock"_
