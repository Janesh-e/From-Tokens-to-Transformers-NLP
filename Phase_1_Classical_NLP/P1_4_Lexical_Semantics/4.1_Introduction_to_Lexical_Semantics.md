## What is **Lexical Semantics**?

**Lexical Semantics** is a subfield of semantics (meaning in language) and linguistics that focuses on the **meaning of words**, their **relationships**, and **how they combine** to form meaning.

> Think of it as: “Let’s teach the machine how words _relate_ to each other — like synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms, etc.”

In NLP, this is **crucial** for tasks like:

- **Word sense disambiguation**
- **Information retrieval**
- **Semantic search**
- **Chatbots & dialogue systems**
- **Knowledge graphs**
- **Question answering systems**

## 📚 Concepts Covered in Lexical Semantics

Let’s break it down into a learning path. You’ll learn both **theory** and **how to implement** these ideas using tools like **NLTK**, **WordNet**, **spaCy**, **Stanza**, and **ConceptNet**.

### 🔹 1. **Word Meaning and Lexemes**

- Lexeme vs Word form
- Homonymy vs Polysemy
- Word sense (definition-level understanding)
- Role of context in deciding meaning

### 🔹 2. **WordNet – The Core Resource**

- What is WordNet?
- Synsets (sets of synonyms)
- WordNet structure (nouns, verbs, adj, adv)
- Navigating relationships:
    - Synonymy
    - Antonymy
    - Hypernymy / Hyponymy (is-a)
    - Meronymy / Holonymy (part-of / whole-of)
    - Troponymy (verb hierarchy)
- Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) using WordNet

🧪 **Tools**: NLTK’s WordNet Interface

### 🔹 3. **Semantic Similarity and Relatedness**

Learn how to **measure the meaning-distance between words**:

| Method               | Description                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Path Similarity      | Shortest path in WordNet hierarchy         |
| Wu-Palmer Similarity | Depth of common ancestor                   |
| Leacock-Chodorow     | Based on max depth & shortest path         |
| Lin / Jiang-Conrath  | Information-content-based similarities     |
| Cosine similarity    | On word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT) |

🧪 Compare:  
`similarity("car", "vehicle")` vs `similarity("car", "fruit")`

### 🔹 4. **Semantic Fields and Ontologies**

- Word fields (sets of related concepts)
- Lexical Fields (grouped by themes)
- Ontologies: How concepts relate in hierarchies
- Resources: **ConceptNet**, **FrameNet**, **DBpedia**

🧪 Explore ConceptNet relations:

- RelatedTo
- Causes
- CapableOf
- UsedFor

### 🔹 5. **Named Entity Semantics (Lite)**

- How names (people, places, orgs) relate semantically
- Tools: spaCy NER, Stanza, Flair, OntoNotes

### 🔹 6. **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)**

Understanding **which meaning** of a word is used in a sentence.

Examples:

- "I went to the **bank** to deposit money."
- "He sat by the **bank** of the river."

Learn WSD Approaches:

|Type|Methods|
|---|---|
|Knowledge-based|Lesk Algorithm (NLTK)|
|Supervised|Naive Bayes / LSTM with labeled datasets|
|Contextual|BERT-based disambiguation (zero-shot)|

🧪 Datasets: SemCor, Senseval, WordNet annotations
