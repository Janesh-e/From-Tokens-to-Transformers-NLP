# **Introduction to Text Classification**

## What is Text Classification?

Text classification is the process of **automatically assigning predefined categories or labels** to text data based on its content.

> Think of it like teaching a machine to **read and tag/label** text.

## Why Is It Important?

|Application|Description|
|---|---|
|**Spam Detection**|Classify emails as “spam” or “not spam”|
|**Sentiment Analysis**|Determine if a review is “positive”, “neutral” or “negative”|
|**Topic Labeling**|News articles → politics, sports, finance, etc.|
|**Intent Detection in Chatbots**|Understand user commands: book_ticket, cancel_order|
|**Toxic Comment Classification**|Identify abusive/harmful content|

## How Does It Work?

It's a **supervised learning task**.

You give a model:

- **Input** → a text document
- **Output** → a label or class

Example:

|Input Text|Label|
|---|---|
|“I loved the movie, it was great!”|Positive|
|“Buy cheap watches now!!!”|Spam|
|“Your payment was successful.”|Transaction|

## 📚 Full Roadmap for Mastering Text Classification

We'll go from **basic rule-based classifiers** to **advanced transformer-based models**.

### 🔸 1. **Problem Framing & Dataset Preparation**

- Multi-class vs Binary vs Multi-label
- Balanced vs Imbalanced datasets
- Train/Test/Validation splits
- Label encoding (LabelEncoder / OneHotEncoder)
- Dealing with noisy/biased labels

### 🔸 2. **Text Preprocessing**

✅ Already covered:

- Tokenization
- Stop words removal
- Stemming / Lemmatization
- Lowercasing
- Regular expressions

### 🔸 3. **Feature Extraction (Text Representation)**

✅ Already covered:

- One-hot Encoding
- Bag of Words
- TF-IDF
- Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)

🆕 We’ll revisit:

- How these are used in classification pipelines
- Converting raw text into feature vectors for models

### 🔸 4. **Classical ML Models for Text Classification**

We'll use Scikit-learn + TF-IDF/BOW/Word Embeddings:

- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB is very popular for text)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forests
- k-NN (rarely used in text, but good to know)

### 🔸 5. **Deep Learning for Text Classification**

Using TensorFlow or PyTorch:

- Feedforward Neural Networks
- CNNs for text
- RNNs (LSTM/GRU)
- Bi-LSTM + Attention mechanisms

### 🔸 6. **Transfer Learning & Pretrained Models (Contextual Embeddings)**

|Model|Description|
|---|---|
|**ELMo**|Contextualized embeddings from LSTM|
|**BERT**|Bi-directional transformer encoder|
|**RoBERTa / ALBERT / DistilBERT**|BERT variants|
|**XLNet**|Permutation-based language modeling|

We'll use HuggingFace Transformers to:

- Fine-tune on custom text classification datasets
- Do zero-shot and few-shot classification

### 🔸 7. **Multilabel & Multi-class Classification**

- Understanding the difference
- Label Binarization vs Label Encoding
- Using `sklearn.metrics` and `classification_report`

### 🔸 8. **Evaluation Metrics**

|Metric|When to Use|
|---|---|
|Accuracy|Balanced datasets|
|Precision & Recall|Imbalanced classes|
|F1 Score|Harmonic mean of precision & recall|
|ROC-AUC|For binary classifiers|
|Hamming Loss|Multi-label classification|
|Confusion Matrix|Understand errors|

### 🔸 9. **Handling Imbalanced Datasets**

- Oversampling (SMOTE)
- Undersampling
- Class weights
- Stratified sampling
